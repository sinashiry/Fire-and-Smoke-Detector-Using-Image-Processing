# Fire and Smoke Detector Using Image-Processing
This system has the ability to detect fire and smoke in open and covered spaces and can analyze the environment in full time and announce the smallest possibility of a fire or the start of a fire.
The purpose of this system is to solve the problem of limiting the use of fire detection sensors in open environments, as well as increasing the detection distance to several hundred meters and reducing the detection time.
The places that are especially candidates for using this system are:

-Refineries and petrochemicals
-Power plants
-All factories (whether open space or inside sheds and roofed space)
-The forests
-Airports and runways
-Military areas
-Sensitive security centers
-Departments, universities and educational centers
-Business centers
